# Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains my implementations and exploration of various sorting and searching algorithms as part of my learning journey in data structures and algorithms.

## About the Project
The primary focus of this project is to:
- Understand and implement common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and others.
- Explore different searching algorithms such as Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- Visualize and analyze the time and space complexity of these algorithms.
- Strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- **Searching Algorithms:**
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

## How to Run
To view and execute the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms.git
    ```
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE such as Google Colab.

## Future Plans
- Adding more advanced sorting algorithms.
- Implementing algorithms for different types of search strategies.
- Optimizing the performance of current algorithms.
- Visualizing algorithm operations in a graphical way.
